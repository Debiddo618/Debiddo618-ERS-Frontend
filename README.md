## :pencil: Descriptions:

The frontend of the Employee Reimbursement System is developed using <b>TypeScript</b> and <b>React</b>, ensuring type safety and a robust user experience. The interface components are crafted with <b>Shadcn</b>, styled with <b>TailwindCSS</b> for a modern and responsive design. For routing, the system leverages the powerful <b>TanStack Router</b>, providing dynamic and efficient page navigation instead of the conventional React Router. Data fetching and state synchronization are handled seamlessly using <b>TanStack Query</b> in combination with <b>Axios,</b> ensuring efficient API requests and real-time data updates from the backend.

The [backend](https://github.com/Debiddo618/ERS) for the Employee Reimbursement System is developed using <b>Java</b> and the <b>Spring Framework</b>, with <b>Spring Security</b> and <b>JWT</b> implemented for user authentication and OAuth. It integrates a <b>PostgreSQL</b> database hosted on <b>AWS</b> for reliable data management. The application is fully <b>dockerized</b> and deployed on an <b>EC2</b> instance, ensuring efficient operation and scalability. However, its availability is constrained to the duration of the AWS free tier period.

## :satellite: Next Steps:

Here are some potential improvements to the project:

- Use Jotai for global state management instead of react context

- Improve style and website responsiveness

- Deploy frontend

- Currently, any manager can promote or demote employees/managers. Therefore, I might want to create a single super manager that can manage promoting/demoting mannagers.
